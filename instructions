              <ol>
                <li>While wearing gloves, rinse jalapenos and remove stem. Cut into 1/4-inch slices and set aside. To reduce the heat from the peppers, you may core out the centers with the seeds and discard before slicing.</li>
                <li>Combine brown sugar and apple cider vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic powder, celery seed, turmeric, cumin seed, anise seed, salt and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer for 3 minutes. Add sliced jalapeno peppers and simmer for an additional 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove jalapenos to a jar using a slotted spoon. Continue simmering liquid over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Pour liquid over the jalapenos and let cool. Use a strainer to remove excess seeds from the liquid, if desired. Refrigerate for a minimum of 3 days before eating. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.</li>
              </ol>
